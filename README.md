# RSNA 2020 Refresher Course
## Hands-on AI for Non-coders: Basics of Information Extraction from Radiology Reports
For the demo, [click here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wfwiggins/RSNA-NLP-2020/blob/master/RSNA20_NLP.ipynb) to open the `RSNA20_NLP.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the development of the demo notebook, please start by creating a fork of this repository.

You can develop the notebook in Colab by following these steps:
- From your fork of the repo, open `RSNA20_NLP.ipynb` in GitHub
- Click the link at the top of the notebook to open it in Colab
- Once in Colab, save a copy of the notebook to your Google Drive
- Edit the notebook...
- When you're ready to push your changes back to GitHub, select *Save a Copy to GitHub* from the File menu and save it back to your repo with a commit message describing what you changed or added
- Finally, return to your GitHub repo to *Compare & Submit a Pull Request*

## TO-DO
**Notebook:**
1. Load test set and assess model performance, compare to validation - WALTER
2. Rename variables to error-proof against cells being run out-of-order - WALTER
3. Improve UI and visuals inside the notebook - IGOR/FELIPE
4. Build in visualization of model inferences - IGOR/WALTER
5. Move "Text Generator" to the end - WALTER

**PowerPoint:**
1. Create Google Drive "Slides" file for high-level explanation of concepts - IGOR
2. t-SNE visualization of embeddings - LUCIANO
3. XML file structure visual - IGOR
4. Summary slide for steps in notebook - WALTER
5. Graph/flow representation of RNN processing text - LUCIANO

**Video:**
1. Record video of notebook presentation - WALTER
2. Divide up slide presentation - IGOR/LUCIANO/FELIPE
3. Record each person's part - IGOR/LUCIANO/FELIPE
4. Edit and combine in Camtasia - LUCIANO
